    "# Hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a tool to optimize black-box function, i.e., functions with unknown structure that are expensive to evaluate.\n",
    "BO consists of the following steps that are repeated until one runs out of time or money:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn a model of the function\n",
    "2. Using this model, find a promising point to evaluate next\n",
    "3. Evaluate the point\n",
    "4. Refine the model using the new observation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will first learn the BO concepts on a simple example and then transfer this to a real-world hyperparameter optimization task. \n",
    "We will use Gaussian processes (GPs) as surrogate models.\n",
    "Together with random forests (RFs), GPs are the most popular type of surrogate model.\n",
    "Generally, a surrogate model for BO must provide an uncertainty estimate, i.e., for a given point, the model should be able to say how certain it is in its prediction."
